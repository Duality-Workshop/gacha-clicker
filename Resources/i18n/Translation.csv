FERRUS_INTRODUCTION,Th'name's Ferrus. I smith. ...keep distance from my forge. I need to focus.
FERRUS_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"If I want to do any decent work around here, I'm gonna need a better workshop."
FERRUS_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,I've been told I haven't been eating enough lately...so.
FERRUS_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,Gonna need a boost if you're wantin' me to hit max production.
FERRUS_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,"Kay, thanks. I'll keep workin'."
FERRUS_RANK_UP,Thanks for the touchin' up.
FERRUS_MAX_RANK,You got nothin' to complain about now. I'll be makin' the sturdiest weapons this kingdom ever did see. And you'll never regret me taking space in this land of yours.
FERRUS_CALLERITE_GIVEN,...you're serious about this? ...then I won't let you down.
FERRUS_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,...fine. If a job is a job.
FERRUS_FEATURED_1,"If you see Leopold, tell 'im to back off from my station unless he wants to be singed."
FERRUS_FEATURED_2,My forge is set hotter than should be for your average smith. Only demons can handle it.
FERRUS_FEATURED_3,You're buyin' me lunch? ...sure. I'll eat with you.
FERRUS_ADDED_TO_PARTY,Roger. Workin' on it.
LEOPOLD_INTRODUCTION,"Greetings, mortal! I, Leopold, will show you the greatness of superior imported weaponry! You're amazed, aren't you?"
LEOPOLD_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Quickly, my friend, I must acquire some imported writings before I begin the real work!"
LEOPOLD_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Oh, how greatly I would like to go further, but...the body, it desires sustenance!"
LEOPOLD_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"I've read and read, but I need to ascend to a much greater scope of knowledge! Quickly, I need the forbidden texts!"
LEOPOLD_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,And so the contract is made! Prepare to be wowed as I conjure up my latest metal creation!
LEOPOLD_RANK_UP,"I can feel it in my soul, my power level..rising to unprescedented levels!"
LEOPOLD_MAX_RANK,"Ohohohoho, yes! I, Leopold, have peaked, and am now fully prepared to make the ultimate blade: Taiyou no Koe! And it's all thanks to you...my treasured friend, who hath always believed in me!"
LEOPOLD_CALLERITE_GIVEN,Gasp! You've found a holy treasure of the otherworldly realm! And I'm the chosen one? I shan't cry...I shan't!
LEOPOLD_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Oh fourteen heavens of the holy hands, ahehe. Where in the lands of Calthesius...did you even get this..?"
LEOPOLD_FEATURED_1,"Measure twice, cut once - that's what they say! But with my special blades, you can measure once, and er...cut twice. Yeah! "
LEOPOLD_FEATURED_2,"I don't just make katanas, you know! I also make powerfully charged talismans to protect you. You never know where creatures in the forest would want to whisk you away to, so power up your chakras and take this!"
LEOPOLD_FEATURED_3,"Has fate allowed you to meet Benji, yet? Why, Benji is only my beloved kin! They're a master in marrying tactical weaponry and practical machinery. If there is anyone in this world who can best me..they are the only one!"
LEOPOLD_ADDED_TO_PARTY,You made the most fortuitous choice!
ANTOINETTE_INTRODUCTION,"Hiiiii there! If you're going to run a kingdom, you'll need all kinds of tonics, won't you? That's where I come in! Antoinette here to offer you my chemist-made wares! I'll give you a discount on the more ""experimental"" vials, okay?"
ANTOINETTE_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Heeeey! If you could do me a favor, could you gimme some parchment, pretty please! I'm out of space for notes!"
ANTOINETTE_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Hi hi! I have a new super corrosive potion, and I need to test it on some really strong axes!"
ANTOINETTE_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"Oops, I'm reaaaaally starting to run out of space for all my experiments! Could you do me one last favor, super pretty please, to help me expand it?"
ANTOINETTE_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,Thanks! This is just the perfect time for me to try out my speed tincture to see how much faster I can go!
ANTOINETTE_RANK_UP,"You upgraded my lab, just for me? Now I'll have all the space to make a hundred more new kinds of potions! Hey, it could even be a thousand!"
ANTOINETTE_MAX_RANK,"Aww, is it really possible? I can't get any better than this? Oh well, this just means no other chemist in the world can top me, all thanks to you!"
ANTOINETTE_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"That's...that's amazing! This is radiating so much, I feel like I have to handle it with gloves..."
ANTOINETTE_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Gosh. I'm uh...definitely gonna need gloves to handle these, but all for science!"
ANTOINETTE_FEATURED_1,"Have you ever felt dull and listless? Have you ever imagined what it's like to touch the sky? Well look no further, because Antoinette's Armoire of Alchemy will--...hey, I'm trying to practice something here, don't listen yet!"
ANTOINETTE_FEATURED_2,"Hey, out of curiosity, what's your favorite food? Do you think more people would be willing to try my tinctures if I made them taste better?"
ANTOINETTE_FEATURED_3,"Lailiel is the best person to work with EVER! They're never afraid to help me with my experiments, so I can't help but spoil them with so many of my own potions. They're just so relaxed about everything, you know?"
ANTOINETTE_ADDED_TO_PARTY,"Oooh, me, you picked me! My time to shine!"
LAILIEL_INTRODUCTION,"I'm...Lailiel. ...to be honest, I've been slumbering in that home nearby for many years, and you woke me from it. But, if you are in need of divine elixirs...I can work on something."
LAILIEL_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,...I have a desire for potato chips.
LAILIEL_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,...I am yearning for some instant ramen.
LAILIEL_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,...I can feel my divine soul clamoring for the sweet release of a burger.
LAILIEL_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,Thank you...for gathering this for me. I can stay awake for a little longer...
LAILIEL_RANK_UP,"Further creation for others, which means more work...but very well, I'll see to more elixirs."
LAILIEL_MAX_RANK,How odd...I don't remember the last time I've felt my body ascend this way.
LAILIEL_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"...be very, very careful with what you do with these...but if you're giving me one, I won't turn away the gift. As long as you're careful, anyways..."
LAILIEL_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,You...you're not really...are you truly intending to follow that path..?
LAILIEL_FEATURED_1,"Were it not for elixir-crafting requiring my attention, I'd be tempted to return to my slumber for another few centuries. I wonder...if Antoinette has anything to keep me awake."
LAILIEL_FEATURED_2,Bottled heavenly light is useful. It makes elixir-making easy thanks to how potent it is..so I don't have to do much work at all.
LAILIEL_FEATURED_3,"I have to pick one thing I like about the moral realm as opposed to the divine plane? ...junk food. The saltier, the better..."
LAILIEL_ADDED_TO_PARTY,"Very well, if you insist..."
BA-YIN_INTRODUCTION,"I'm most welcome to meet you. You can call me Ba-Yin, and I'm trained in calligraphy. Should you need me to script anything for you, you need only call me."
BA-YIN_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"If I could kindly ask you a favor, I'm in charge of stocking the office for Hoto and I with refreshments. Would you happen to have any to offer?"
BA-YIN_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"My apologies for sending in a request again, but my desk is beginning to deteriorate and is affecting my work. Would it be possible to arrange a replacement for me, please?"
BA-YIN_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"You've been most generous to me in the past. If I could ask one last thing of you, would you be able to help me stock the first aid kit? I've just found out the one we currently have is not up to code."
BA-YIN_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,You have my gratitude. I won't put this offering to waste.
BA-YIN_RANK_UP,"You're much too kind to offer me this, I'm grateful."
BA-YIN_MAX_RANK,"All my life, I've trained to make my calligraphy as beautiful as it is..all for this recognition of my trade, at last. Thank you sincerely for humoring me."
BA-YIN_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"My leader, you...truly intend to give this to me? I'm not deserving of such an honor, but, I'll accept this generous gesture."
BA-YIN_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,It would be rude of me not to accept your gift...thank you.
BA-YIN_FEATURED_1,"One, two, three, four strokes...ah, shoot. This scroll is not as beautiful as it should be. One, two..."
BA-YIN_FEATURED_2,"I'm thankful that Hoto and Saluken have been so kind to me. It's hard to be able to pull myself from my work, but I don't regret spending time with them to relax. We always like to get sweets from Kiki."
BA-YIN_FEATURED_3,"Calligraphy is a lot more than just writing words. It's the ability to immortalize the way we communicate into art. If you would like me to teach you someday, I would be happy to."
BA-YIN_ADDED_TO_PARTY,My brush is inked.
HOTO_INTRODUCTION,"Hello there. If you're going to build a kingdom, it's only suiting that you'll need a historian, won't you? My name is Hoto. I will work with you to make your kingdom unforgettable."
HOTO_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Excuse me, but I've got to catch up with my work and I need some help picking up my medicine. Could you go visit Lailiel to get it for me, please?"
HOTO_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Well, you won't believe this, but Lailiel just sort of gave up, I suppose. The potion they gave me ended up being some kind of sickly drink. Can you go back to make sure they get it right this time, please?"
HOTO_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"I feel...so exhausted. I swear it, I'm going to strangle Lailiel for making me so sick. One last time, I promise...perhaps just go to a different potion maker instead? Anyone could be more reliable than Lailiel is..."
HOTO_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,Perfect...I'll have more records ready for you in just a moment.
HOTO_RANK_UP,"I'll be able to record faster now, then? Good! Let's see if I can keep up."
HOTO_MAX_RANK,"It's a little difficult to find the words for this great honor, but you by and large honor me. You're still a pleasure to work with, and we'll make history yet, hm?"
HOTO_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"There's no way...how did you even get this? Well. Before my imagination goes too wild, I'll accept your offer. Thank you."
HOTO_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,Thank you...I suppose?
HOTO_FEATURED_1,"I've met a few people who find it natural to make fun of my lunches, calling them ""mere rabbit food"". Well...frankly, my health is going to be thankful for it being rabbit food, won't it?"
HOTO_FEATURED_2,"Where I get my clothes? Oh, hehe. It's a small shop that used to make clothes all like this, called Marian Maiden. Why, do you want to try dress like this, too?"
HOTO_FEATURED_3,"I'm grateful that Ba-Yin is easy to work with. I doubt she is the kind of person to be a huge part of a history book, but it's those kinds of people that really help the world run."
HOTO_ADDED_TO_PARTY,Alright then! Ready to go.
UGOLYA_INTRODUCTION,"Yoooooo, my friend! You and your people are hungry, aren't you? That's what I thought, so eat up! All this jerky is an Ugolya specialty, so don't waste any of it!"
UGOLYA_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Yo, leader friend! I hear there's some new beast in the forests that's been showing up. Get me some journals about it before I leave on my next trip?"
UGOLYA_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Everything is ready to go, but I need a very specific weapon for this new forest beast! You'll give me a halberd, right?"
UGOLYA_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"Danger, danger my friend! The first attack against the forest beast went very, VERY badly! You must give me more power! ..two halberds, perhaps?"
UGOLYA_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,"I could make do with a piece of string, you know. But alright, I'll make something good soon with what you gave me!"
UGOLYA_RANK_UP,"Meat, meat...MEAAAAAAT! More meat!"
UGOLYA_MAX_RANK,"And just like that, you're all set for life! Adventures? Camping? War? Being stranded on a faraway desert? Now you'll have food for everything!"
UGOLYA_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"What's this shiny rock even for, huh? All colorful for some decoration, I bet--...OHHHHHHHHH!"
UGOLYA_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Ohoh boy. You've been going to crazy places, my friend."
UGOLYA_FEATURED_1,"What's that? This one is too salty for you? Nonsense talk! It's very important for preservation, you know. No salt, no life for food! And no life for your taste buds."
UGOLYA_FEATURED_2,"Words of wisdom from me, Ugolya: never fire roast a pig in the middle of a pine forest that's on a cliff. Well, no, roast a pig anyways! Just not a giant pig. ...what, who doesn't get excited about eating a giant pig?"
UGOLYA_FEATURED_3,"I see Morgause very often on my travels! We eat together, but they always say no to a hike. For good reason, too. Even with their power, they're as strong as a toothpick."
UGOLYA_ADDED_TO_PARTY,You will not regret what I'll cook up!
KIKI_INTRODUCTION,K...Kiki. ...please eat my pastries.
KIKI_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Oh...oh no, I'm out of my special donut glaze...what am I going to do..?"
KIKI_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Hoto wants a special kind of bread, but...I don't have the recipe for it at all. Can...can you help me..?"
KIKI_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"You...y-you don't have to do this, but, if I could have my own real bakery, I..."
KIKI_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,"...thank you, so, so much."
KIKI_RANK_UP,"Ah...okay, I'll bake more for you."
KIKI_MAX_RANK,...I feel so happy. I'm going to have to make a very special cake to celebrate this moment...
KIKI_CALLERITE_GIVEN,..! T-th-thank you! Thank you! Thank you...
KIKI_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Your gift, there's...t-there's something wrong with it..."
KIKI_FEATURED_1,"I like selling my pastries, but...I'm never any good at greeting customers. And when they compliment my food, I...never know how to say thank you."
KIKI_FEATURED_2,"Okay...you can pat my head. Once. But, only...if you help me clean the dishes."
KIKI_FEATURED_3,"...I don't like Gloria. I don't know why, I'm sorry...she just puts an unsettling feeling in me. It makes my tail shiver..."
KIKI_ADDED_TO_PARTY,Coming right up...
SALUKEN_INTRODUCTION,"It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Saluken, and I'm here as your civil engineer. I know this was just a mere arranged assignment, but I hope my skills can be of help to you."
SALUKEN_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Hey there! I'm going to have to read up some more on the environment of this area before I work out the zoning. Is it okay if you can get me some books, please?"
SALUKEN_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Oh no, it looks like the lighting on this road is going to be down for a while...but we can fix it temporarily! Maybe with some liquid light potions?"
SALUKEN_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"I'm sorry, I really don't want to be a burden to you about this, but um...I've been scouting all day today and I forgot to pack my lunch..."
SALUKEN_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,You're giving these to me? Thank you. I'll put these resources to good use!
SALUKEN_RANK_UP,"I should be able to work much more efficiently like this! Hold tight, everyone. I'm going to work even harder for the kingdom!"
SALUKEN_MAX_RANK,"You've helped me come so far. By all accounts, you didn't have to put your faith in me, but...you did. Thank you for giving me the chance to help make this Domain the best it can be. Because the world of Calthesius needs it."
SALUKEN_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"Wait, is that...callerite?! My leader, there's no way you're giving it to me, I...oh, this is the highest form of praise I could ever ask for!"
SALUKEN_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Dear leader, I appreciate your gift, but...well, if it's going to make the world a better place..."
SALUKEN_FEATURED_1,"The newest pipeline is good to go, and we went through the current house zoning with perfect synergy. What's next now..."
SALUKEN_FEATURED_2,"Building a pool wouldn't be advisable in this sector. But...I'll see what I can do elsewhere. If I'm being honest, I would really love to wade in a pool!"
SALUKEN_FEATURED_3,"I try my best to be open-minded to everyone, but sometimes it's...a little hard with Arnia. There's nothing wrong with dreaming, but interior work involves the lives of people. Why would you want to risk that for a funny-looking design?"
SALUKEN_ADDED_TO_PARTY,"You're choosing to hire me? I'm simply elated, thank you!"
ARNIA_INTRODUCTION,"Buongiorno! That's Finnish for ""we haven't met before."" I'm Arnia, and look no further for your new favorite interior designer! If I can imagine it, then I can make it happen!"
ARNIA_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Pardonez-moi! For my current client's room, they want some decorative books for their bookcase. They don't actually read. But they want books. So books, pleaaaase!"
ARNIA_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,"Oi, oi! I have another client! Get me some swords so I can hang them up on the wall, okay? It'll be super fancy!"
ARNIA_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"Sumimasen! My newest client has just the most luxurious tastes, and wants to have their entire room emit simulated biolumniescence! I need glow potions to pour on all the furniture, and LOTS of them!"
ARNIA_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,"Okie dokie, I'll spruce up more rooms real fast, and I'll make them ""bee-spoke"" too!"
ARNIA_RANK_UP,"Ooh! More shinies to play with? Just you wait, you're going to see so many colors in this room, it's going to make you dizzy!"
ARNIA_MAX_RANK,"You're so amazing! If I told everyone at home that someone actually believed in me enough to let me design my furnishings, no one would believe me...chicken-shaped building, here I come!"
ARNIA_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"I can't believe it! You're an innovator, an inventor, and everything important, yes, yes, YES! My star is shining!"
ARNIA_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Puaf! This decoration sure is unique, but something about it is so stinky!"
ARNIA_FEATURED_1,"I first fell in love with my job when I learned about ball chairs. Whoever invented those was such a genius, letting people like you and me be able to sit inside a ball at home! So cozy..."
ARNIA_FEATURED_2,"Some time when we're not working, we need to try go to the candy shop together! I know a place that makes amazing dragonfruit truffles. I bet you never tried those, huh?"
ARNIA_FEATURED_3,"It's always really nice when someone listens to all your blabbering, isn't it? That's why Saluken is the best! I can tell her everything and she'll understand it all!"
ARNIA_ADDED_TO_PARTY,"Let's get a new design going, right away!"
MORGAUSE_INTRODUCTION,"Ooh, my my. It's not very often that I get to see another soul in my travels like this. I am the master sage, Morgause. If you're truly begging for my help, then I'll just have to offer what I can, shouldn't I?"
MORGAUSE_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Not to insult our dear companions, but..I simply need my own secluded space to be able to work properly. Would you be a dear and arrange a cabin for me?"
MORGAUSE_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,It's been a while since I've been in touch with the concoctions the kids are making nowadays. Could you fetch me some fresh potions so I can study them?
MORGAUSE_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,"Truly, how much work burdens the body...you'll get me a snack to remedy this, won't you? I'll take a fresh honeydew melon."
MORGAUSE_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,"This will do well enough for now, thank you."
MORGAUSE_RANK_UP,"You're finally paying attention to my abilities, are you? Better late than never. I'll show you just how much better the work of a master sage can be."
MORGAUSE_MAX_RANK,"Oh my. I didn't think I could grow in power any more than I already did on my own, but you managed to prove me wrong. I suppose I'll have to thank you, right?"
MORGAUSE_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"...hehehe. A dangerous decision, but you've chosen the right one."
MORGAUSE_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"...you're trying to make me change sides, aren't you?"
MORGAUSE_FEATURED_1,"I don't regret all the time I've spent mastering my powers. But I do admit...maybe, just maybe it gets a little lonely sometimes. And no need to tease me for it. I'm still human."
MORGAUSE_FEATURED_2,"Ugolya...that girl has so much energy. Too much for me at times, but I can always appreciate someone who never makes a moment dull."
MORGAUSE_FEATURED_3,"Meeting you the way I did was the ideal outcome, for sure. Why, in a different time, and in a different place...oh my. It could've been very possible you wouldn't be standing here if you were to match against me."
MORGAUSE_ADDED_TO_PARTY,"Let's show anything standing in our way who the real victor is, shall we?"
BENJI_INTRODUCTION,"Hey there, bud, the name's Benji! So, I hear you're building a Domain? Well, you're gonna need to be bold and learn how to take calculated risks. That's what a warmaster like me is for! "
BENJI_UPGRADE_REQUEST_1,"Before we really get going, first things first: I'm gonna need reinforcements in weapon stock! Hey, you need weapons to make weapons."
BENJI_UPGRADE_REQUEST_2,Looks like I got a bit hasty with the adhesive. Mind if you can stop by for some solvents so that I can seal these contraptions together?
BENJI_UPGRADE_REQUEST_3,I'm gonna have to record this new axe-gun before I get to carried away with it. Could you be a pal and top me off with some parchment?
BENJI_UPGRADE_COMPLETE,"Appreciate it. It's just a start, but I can easily put something together with this."
BENJI_RANK_UP,"You're putting your faith in me, eh? That's what I like to see!"
BENJI_MAX_RANK,"I'm so used to having to make home defense out of a few slabs of wood and twine. But with all that you've given me, nothing can stop us. No kingdom will ever know what hit 'em, now and forever more!"
BENJI_CALLERITE_GIVEN,"Well now! That's an interesting artifact you got there. I figured I'd wanna bash out how to improve by myself, but...fair is fair, ain't it?"
BENJI_FAUXLERITE_GIVEN,"Whoah, hold it there! I can always appreciate more ammo, but you better watch it with all this. It's dangerous. Might make the village go nuclear."
BENJI_FEATURED_1,"You're asking me how I got all these scars? Well, I mean...it's only natural, right, when you make as many trebuchets as I do. Surely you understand."
BENJI_FEATURED_2,"You've met my brother, Leopold, right? You can't miss him. He's a little confused and try hard in some of the wrong areas, but he's got the bold energy it takes to be a weapon crafter."
BENJI_FEATURED_3,"Have you listened to Arnia, much? She keeps mentioning about these lands called ""Italy"" or ""Finland"", but...I have no clue what she's talking about. Do you think they're regions we've yet to discover? I can't find any records about them. It could be an exciting venture."
BENJI_ADDED_TO_PARTY,"Ready to try something new, captain?"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_1,"Well hi there, traveler! What brings you around here in this dim and empty place?"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_2,"Oh. You came here on purpose? Even through the corrupting crystals of the Fractured Haze, all just to come here?"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_3,I see. You must be the new Leader of this soon-to-be Domain!
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_4,"If that's the case, I may just stick around to help you out a bit. I do have a great instinct for business, after all."
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_5,"I'm Gloria, just a traveling shopkeeper with tons of wares, meow!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_6,"If you're going to build a community, you're going to need some Resources - and some help!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_7,...me gather the Resources for you? No way! I'm not built for physical labor.
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_8,"I do have some of these to get you started, though. Call Crystals!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_9,"Legend has it that when you toss a Call Crystal into the sky, it shines a beacon across the whole realm."
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_10,"Resources from the land will appear, and talented souls seeking refuge will come to you!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART1_11,"Go ahead, give it a bunch of tries! Some help should arrive in no time!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART2_1,"…so, help has not arrived in any time. Wow. Your luck must be terrible."
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART2_2,"But, don't worry, I have some connections, meow!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART2_3,"Besides, I hear this girl's been desperate for some work, so…"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART2_4,"Be nice, okay?"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART2_5,"Aaaand with that, your first Unit is here, so I can go set up shop!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_1,"If you need any advice on how to lead, just click on the Help icons for pointers!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_2,"Oh, and don't be a stranger. Come to my shop too, okay?"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_3,"I have tons of goodies to offer, all just for you!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_4,"Speaking of…before I go, here. Take some Callerite!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_5,"It’s rare, but very valuable. A gift just for you, and you’ll need it for my shop!"
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_6,"You could use it for your future Units too. If you wanted, I suppose."
GLORIA_INTRO1_PART3_7,"Okay, that’s all! Good luck, and see you soon, meow!"
GLORIA_INTRO2_1,"Well hi there, traveler!"
GLORIA_INTRO2_2,…
GLORIA_INTRO2_3,"You already know what I’m going to say, aren’t you?"
GLORIA_INTRO2_4,Replay the tutorial?
GLORIA_INTRO2_5,Alright! Fiiiiiine. Ahem.
GLORIA_GREETING_1,"Hi hi hi, welcome to my shop! Be sure to take a good look around, okay?"
GLORIA_GREETING_2,"I have a bunch of bargains fresh from the bargain tree, meow!"
GLORIA_GREETING_3,"Seeing your face here in my shop always makes me so pleased, [PLAYER NAME]!"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_GREETING_1,"Hey sweetie, darling, bestie, dearie, babe. Now, show me your damn Callerite."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_GREETING_2,Buy something.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_GREETING_3,You know why you’re here.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_GREETING_1,"Hey, you. Do you feel like buying something?"
GLORIA_DEDICATION_GREETING_2,It’s good to see you again. Take your time.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_GREETING_3,Come on in. I found a few things for cheap this morning.
GLORIA_PURCHASE_1,"Wowee, thank you so much! Enjoy your goods, meow!"
GLORIA_PURCHASE_2,"Nice buy! Has anyone told you that you’re looking wonderful today, [PLAYER NAME]?"
GLORIA_PURCHASE_3,"I knew that you’d end up making smart decisions, meow!"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_PURCHASE_1,There you go. Now run along and keep playing for now.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_PURCHASE_2,Good. Good for you.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_PURCHASE_3,I’ll see you again in a minute.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_PURCHASE_1,"Thank you, so much."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_PURCHASE_2,"I hope you enjoy your purchase. Take a break for a bit before you come back, okay? For both our sakes."
GLORIA_HELP_UNIT_1,"This window shows all the Units you’ve called with your Call Crystals! If you enlist a Unit into your Party of six, they’ll passively craft more Resources for you."
GLORIA_HELP_UNIT_2,"Whenever you call a Unit you already have, they’ll automatically Rank Up and get stronger, meow!"
GLORIA_HELP_UNIT_3,"Every now and then, they’ll also have requests for you. Should you offer them the Resources they ask for, then they’ll be Upgraded!"
GLORIA_HELP_UNIT_4,Keep using your Call Crystals and listening to their requests to watch your team grow!
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_1,"If you’re in need of my wares, just come to my shop, meow!"
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_2,"You’ll need Callerite to buy things. But if you have it, I can offer you amazing buffs that can help take your Domain to the next level!"
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_3,"Sometimes I have freebies, too. You don’t want to miss out on them, so make sure to check into my shop often, okay?"
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_4,"Oh, and Saluken is here with me, too. She’s in charge of upgrading your Domain."
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_5,"Your Domain starts off very small as only a tiny, miniscule, village. But your Domain will improve if you complete all the necessary Upgrades!"
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_6,"You’ll need Resources to complete these Upgrades, of course."
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_7,"Once you complete all the required Upgrades for a tier, then your Domain will expand."
GLORIA_HELP_SHOP_8,"Maybe with enough effort, your Domain will turn into a massive kingdom, meow!"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_1,…
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_2,…heh.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_3,So you’ve accepted it.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_4,That warm feeling that comes up whenever I make a sale.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_5,"You get it too, don’t you?"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_6,Can’t get enough of it?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_7,That satisfaction that comes so quickly.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_8,How nice.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_9,It’s always nice to have a customer…
GLORIA_ADDICTION_TRIGGER_10,…that’s just as hungry as me.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_1,Hehee…hehehehee…
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_2,I’ve been on such a high that I didn’t realize how the time passed.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_3,Every waking moment to me is one where you beckon me.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_4,Where you beg for my help.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_5,"But, it is about that time."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_6,You’ve brought the Fractured Haze into your Domain.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_7,"Any moment now, the crystals are going to take over this pretend world."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_8,"I must say, I’m amazed. You’ve really let it all go to hell in record time."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_9,"Faster than any “Leader” than I’ve met, [PLAYER NAME]."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_10,"Alas, when the Fractured Haze takes over, there’s no reason for me to be here anymore."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_11,There’s nothing left to take from.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_12,"So! Thank you. I’m off to the next Leader, with their next Domain, with a new Shop."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_13,"Where I’ll just do it over, and over, and over, and over, and over again."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_14,Until…I’m satisfied.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_15,"It’s been real, [PLAYER NAME]."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING1_16,See you never.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_1,Heehee….eheeheeheehee!
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_2,I’ve been on such a high that I didn’t realize how the time passed.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_3,Every waking moment to me…
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_4,…I see you.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_5,"Begging for my wares, demanding my help."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_6,"I see it, and I’ve seen it before, haven’t I?"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_7,Which means you have.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_8,You’ve done all this before.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_9,"You’ve single-handedly brought this Domain to ruin, and you’ve come back to do it again."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_10,What is wrong with you?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_11,Don’t tell me. Have you…
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_12,Done this to waste my time?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_13,I could be getting a perfectly good fix from another “Leader” elsewhere.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_14,"Well, all over again, this Domain is going to shit all thanks to you."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_15,So! Like I said.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_16,See you never.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_17,"Don’t talk to me again, [PLAYER NAME]."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING2_18,I have better things to do.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_1,Hehehe…hehehee..! Hehehehee!
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_2,"I’ve been on such a high, that…"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_3,…it took me forever to realize.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_4,[i]You.[/i]
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_5,You did it. Again.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_6,It’s like this pretend world - and me - are just your toys that you play with to see what happens.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_7,"You keep making me gobble up that brief, tiny, miniscule feeling of warmth."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_8,That feeling of making a sale.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_9,That sensation of feeling anything at all.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_10,You keep dangling it around me and stuffing me with it until there’s nothing left.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_11,And you keep me here.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_12,Are you trying to make me suffer more than I already am?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_13,You really think punishing me is going to make me any better?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_14,Or do you feel some kind of sick satisfaction in knowing that I’m just as long gone as you are?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_15,"Well, I won’t let you have it!"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_16,"Keep resetting, keep rebuilding, keep buying, and keep burning this world to the fucking ground!"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_17,And what’ll be of me?
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_18,"I’ll be a mindless ghost. A sack of flesh that’ll only exist to sell, and sell, and sell, and sell!"
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_19,"If you dare do this again. I promise you, that if you see me, then there’s nothing left."
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_20,I won’t let you see through me anymore.
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING3_21,[b]Ever. Again.[/b]
GLORIA_ADDICTION_ENDING4_1,"Just do the reset, already. I have nothing else left to say."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_1,"So, you finally got your big castle, did you?"
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_2,"When you first started, I didn’t actually think you could do it."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_3,"Maybe you’d make it halfway through, then hit that point of frustration."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_4,"That point where everything seems to be taking too long, where you thought you knew everything."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_5,Where this pretend world throws something your way to make it harder.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_6,"To the point that you would want more, more, and more help."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_7,My help.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_8,"You didn’t buy my help, but…it’s not like you never visited."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_9,It’s frustrating.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_10,"Whenever I make a sale, it brings me excitement. Meaning. It warms my heart."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_11,And I just keep wanting more.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_12,"Sometimes, making that purchase happen feels like all that I’m worth."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_13,"…but you knew better than that, didn’t you?"
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_14,You were able to decide that you don’t have to just rely on my help.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_15,"You found a way to rely on me, but also your Units, your wits, and your determination."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_16,…how?
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_17,How do you just do that?
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_18,How could you be so much stronger than I am?
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_19,What did you have to go through to stand where you are?
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_20,…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_21,You’re different from them.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_22,Different from the ones that brought the Fractured Haze to this pretend world.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_23,"So maybe, there was hope for you all along."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_24,…do you think there’s hope for me?
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_25,I don’t know.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_26,"[PLAYER NAME], I’ve outgrown you."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_27,…is what I wish I could say was the truth.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_28,"Really, you’re the one that’s outgrown me."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_29,I’ll pack up the shop.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_30,I have some thinking to do.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_31,Don’t come after me.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_32,"Like I said, I don’t know if there’s any hope for me."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_33,Don’t be sad about me.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_34,Besides. Your Units…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_35,…your friends.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_36,"They’re the ones that have shed their blood, sweat, and tears to help make this world a better place for you."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_37,So don’t forget about them.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING1_38,"Goodbye, [PLAYER NAME]."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_1,"So, you finally got your big castle, didn’t you?"
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_2,"When you first started, I didn’t think you’d actually do it."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_3,And I also didn’t think…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_4,That you’d do this all over again.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_5,"There’s no reason for you to, you know."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_6,You probably did this again because you thought that I’d say something different.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_7,"That maybe, you could convince me to think otherwise, to change my mind."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_8,You shouldn’t have to.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_9,But then again…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_10,Maybe I’m imagining things.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_11,"You already took this path once out of your kindness, so you could just be doing it again because that’s the type of person you are."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_12,Which means…this doesn’t matter.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_13,I’m really flattered that you think I’m worth coming back to.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_14,Or just…implying that I could have any value.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_15,But please. I mean it.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_16,"You shouldn’t come after me, or waste your time."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_17,I’m not strong enough to be like you. I don’t know if I’m worth your hope.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_18,Even if…you bringing me back here…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING2_19,…is almost making me believe it.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_1,…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_2,"You worked so hard to bring the Domain to this level again, which means we’re back here."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_3,You really…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_4,Were calling me back here on purpose.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_5,"Letting me live another life, where I can get a semblance of that warmth... of that meaning."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_6,"All while allowing this pretend, made-up world to prosper and be protected from harm."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_7,I don’t understand how you have that patience.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_8,All the other “Leaders” - the ones that caused the Fractured Haze. They didn’t have that patience.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_9,"They fed into my desire for happiness, over and over again, until there was nothing left."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_10,But you…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_11,"You were so stupid, so foolish, so…"
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_12,Bold.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_13,So strong to stay here like this.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_14,"Please, don’t play with my emotions. I need to ask."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_15,"Do you think I’m worth something, even if it’s hard for me to close the Shop?"
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_16,…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_17,…right.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_18,Of course. My mistake. You were really just doing all this because…that’s the routine.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_19,"So be it, then."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_20,Yes
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_21,…thank you.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_22,And I’m sorry I even had to ask you.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_23,"But, hearing it aloud, I feel…lighter."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_24,…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_25,[PLAYER NAME].
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_26,I don’t think I’m going to be able to change how I feel about my Shop anytime soon.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_27,"After all, somewhere in those fleeting moments, I feel some kind of happiness. And I don’t want to get rid of it."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_28,"I’m probably going to keep coming back to it, one way or another."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_29,"Despite that…if you believe in me this much, then I want to at least try."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_30,"I don’t know why I’m here, why I’ve been put here, and how I even found you in the end."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_31,So I might as well make something good out of me being here.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_32,"Even if this world isn’t reality to me, or to you."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_33,It feels real.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_34,And for that reason…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_35,I’ll do my best.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_36,"Don’t worry, I won’t be trying to hide myself much from you."
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_37,I know I’m going to fail horribly sometimes.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_38,But that’s okay.
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_39,Because apparently…
GLORIA_DEDICATION_ENDING3_40,I am worth more than a brief moment of joy.
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_1,"Hey…wait. You’re joking, right?"
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_2,"I promised you that I’d try to be better, so you have to be fair to me, too."
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_3,"You don’t really want to buy that after all we’ve been through, do you?"
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_4,"Phew…good. You freaked me out for a second there, [PLAYER NAME]."
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_5,So you’re…seriously giving up on me.
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_6,And I have to just go with it?
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_7,…
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_8,No.
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_9,"I can’t take this. At least, not like this."
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_10,I can’t stop you from whatever you want to do. Go ahead and just go back to how it was.
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_11,But I’m staying in this memory and not letting you have it.
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_12,"I’m sorry for being selfish. But if you’re going to do this, then I’m going to take power over the one thing I have left."
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_13,The next time you see me…
GLORIA_BETRAYAL_14,[b]I won’t remember any of this.[/b]
